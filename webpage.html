<p>Sleeping is a fine art. It requires a lot of tuning, one does not simply sleep. One relaxes, wastes time on internet, thinks about worthless aspects of life, and all while laying on the finest of linens. After completing those prerequisites, then you can finally drift into the dream world where you can chill doing whatever it is you do in your dreams. And once you've gone through all of that you can wake up to the a nice morning sun with coffee and spend the rest of the day in agony until you can finally sleep again.</p>

<p>If you're feeling like going out in the sun, I find hammocks near the lake or ocean to be the most calming. Just don't fall off the hammock or invite crappy friends that'll tip it over while you're trying to relax.</p>
